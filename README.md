# angular-starter-project

This is a template for getting started quickly with a pre-configured AngluarJS & Bootstrap tech stack. To get the initial project running you'll need to have NodeJS installed on your computer.

- NodeJS [https://nodejs.org/en/]

Once you have NodeJS installed navigate to the projects root directory and run:

`npm install` 

After the installation is finished we'll also need to install the bower packages:

`bower install`

After bower has finished installing you will be able to run the application from localhost:

`gulp serve`

The application should now be running succesfully on your local machine.
